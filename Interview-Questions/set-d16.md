### Batch 17 - Swift Generics & Type Constraints

1. **What are generic functions and generic types? How do you create reusable generic code?**

2. **Explain type constraints in generics. How do you use where clauses with multiple constraints?**

3. **What are constrained extensions? How do you extend generic types with specific requirements?**

4. **How do you implement generic protocols with Self requirements? What limitations exist?**

5. **What is the difference between <T: Protocol> and <T> where T: Protocol? Are they equivalent?**

6. **Explain covariance and contravariance in Swift generics. How do they affect type relationships?**

7. **How do you use generic type aliases? Provide examples with complex nested types.**

8. **What are existential types vs generic types? When should you use each?**

9. **How do you implement generic data structures (Stack, Queue, LinkedList) in Swift?**

10. **What is specialization in Swift generics? How does the compiler optimize generic code?**

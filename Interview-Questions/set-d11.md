### Batch 12 - Advanced Swift Concepts

1. **What are value types vs reference types in Swift? Explain copy-on-write optimization.**

2. **What is ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)? How does it differ from garbage collection?**

3. **Explain strong, weak, and unowned reference cycles in closures. How do you prevent memory leaks?**

4. **What are escaping vs non-escaping closures? When and why do you use @escaping?**

5. **What is type erasure in Swift? How do you create a type-erased wrapper for protocols with associated types?**

6. **Explain higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, compactMap, flatMap). Provide complex examples.**

7. **What are opaque return types (some keyword)? How do they differ from generic return types?**

8. **What is the difference between struct and class? When should you choose one over the other?**

9. **Explain lazy properties and lazy sequences. How do they optimize performance?**

10. **What are variadic parameters, inout parameters, and default parameter values in Swift functions?**

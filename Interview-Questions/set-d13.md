### Batch 14 - Swift Enums & Pattern Matching

1. **What are associated values in enums? How do they differ from raw values? Provide practical examples.**

2. **How do you implement recursive enums in Swift? What is the @indirect keyword?**

3. **Explain pattern matching with switch statements. What are value binding and where clauses?**

4. **How do you use enums to model state machines in Swift? Provide a real-world example.**

5. **What are CaseIterable and RawRepresentable protocols? How do you use them with enums?**

6. **How do you compare enums with associated values? Explain Equatable conformance for complex enums.**

7. **What is tuple pattern matching? How do you destructure tuples in switch statements?**

8. **How do you use enums for error handling? Explain custom error types with associated values.**

9. **What are optional patterns and for-case-let loops? When are they useful?**

10. **How do you implement namespace enums (caseless enums)? What are their use cases?**

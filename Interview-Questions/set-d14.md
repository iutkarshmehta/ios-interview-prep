### Batch 15 - Swift Collections & Algorithms

1. **What are the differences between Array, Set, and Dictionary? When should you use each for optimal performance?**

2. **Explain collection indexing in Swift. What are startIndex, endIndex, and index(after:)?**

3. **How do you implement custom collections in Swift? Explain Collection protocol requirements.**

4. **What are Sequence and IteratorProtocol? How do you create custom sequences?**

5. **Explain lazy collections and lazy evaluation. How do they improve performance with large datasets?**

6. **What are the time complexities of common operations (insert, delete, search) in Array, Set, and Dictionary?**

7. **How do you use sort, sorted, and custom sorting with KeyPath comparisons in Swift?**

8. **What is the difference between map vs flatMap vs compactMap on collections? Provide examples for each.**

9. **How do you implement efficient searching algorithms (binary search, linear search) on Swift collections?**

10. **What are ContiguousArray and ArraySlice? When would you use them over standard Array?**

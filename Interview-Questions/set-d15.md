### Batch 16 - Swift Protocols & Extensions

1. **What are protocol inheritance and protocol composition? How do you combine multiple protocols?**

2. **Explain associated types in protocols. How do they differ from generic type parameters?**

3. **What is Self (capital S) vs self (lowercase) in protocols? When do you use each?**

4. **How do you provide conditional conformance to protocols? Explain where clauses with extensions.**

5. **What are class-only protocols? How do you restrict protocols to reference types?**

6. **Explain retroactive modeling. How do you make existing types conform to protocols via extensions?**

7. **What are protocol witnesses and witness tables in Swift? How does the compiler resolve protocol conformance?**

8. **How do you handle protocol conflicts when two protocols have methods with the same signature?**

9. **What is the difference between static dispatch, dynamic dispatch, and witness table dispatch?**

10. **How do you create protocol-based dependency injection? Explain testability benefits.**
